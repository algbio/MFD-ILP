# MFD-ILP
Fast and exact ILP-based solvers for the Minimum Flow Decomposition (MFD) problem, and variants of it.

The solveers are implemented using the Python API using two different linear programming solvers (CPLEX and Gurobi).
Final version of the scrips will be available by November 9th, 2021.
