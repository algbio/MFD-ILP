# MFD-ILP
Fast and exact ILP-based solvers for the Minimum Flow Decomposition (MFD) problem, and variants of it.

The solvers are implemented using Python with the API for two different linear programming solvers: CPLEX and Gurobi.

# Requirements

Python:
  itertools
  more_itertools
  math as m
  os 
  networkx as nx
  
 CPLEX Python API or Gurobi Python API (both version of the codes are available)
 
 Jupyter Notebook
 
 # Standard Formulation
 In this version, a standard k-Minimum Flow Decomposition is solved using
